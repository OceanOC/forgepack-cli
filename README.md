# forgepack-cli
A simple CLI for extracting Curse Forge modpacks.
## Usage
Either drag and drop the modpack ZIP file onto the executable or use the command line: \
``forgepack-cli [zipfile]``
###### NOTE: This only downloads the mods and extracts the mod overrides from the ZIP file, and does not download the modloader or add it to the minecraft launcher
